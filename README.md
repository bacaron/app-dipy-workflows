# Dipy Workflow Wrapper

This is a Brainlife wrapper App for various Dipy workflows (dipy_* commands installed as part of Dipy distribution). This single wrapper is exposed through multiple Dipy Apps registered on Brainlife.io. The code then runs different Dipy workflow based on "command" parameter as part of `config.json` generated by various Brainlife Apps.

Please [dipy homepage](nipy.org/dipy/) for more information about Dipy.
